Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Needless to say, I keep in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (Wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (Wreck)
Needless to say, I'm keeping in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Every time I'm leavin' on ya (Ooh)
You don't make it easy, no (No, no)
Wish I could be there for ya (Ooh)
Give me a reason to, oh (Oh)
Every time I'm walkin' out (Oh)
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around (Oh, oh)
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down (No)
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (Now)
I know you're scared of the unknown (Known)
You don't wanna be alone (Alone)
I know I always come and go (And go)
But it's out of my control

[Chorus: Post Malone]
And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower (Yeah)`,

[Chorus: Roisee & Young Thug]
Not done fighting, I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feeling like it's all too much
I feel beaten, but I can't give up
I'm still fighting (Metro), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feelin' like it's all too much
I feel beaten, but I can't give up

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh (No way), wakin' up, feelin' like the thankful one
Count up my 1s, lacin' up my favorite ones
One of a kind, one of one, the only one
Got one shot and one chance to take it once (No way)
Kiss my mama on the forehead, 'fore I get the code red
'Cause I was born, bred to go in, toast read
And swing by 410, beef patty, cornbread
In the concrete jungle, where my home is (No way)
All get focused, all range of toast is
For nickname, Mr. King-of-do-the-mostest
I was livin' down bad in my folks' crib
Now I'm laughin' to the bank and the joke is (No way)
Did more things than folks did or folks get
We've been gettin' this fly since some poor kids
My rich friends and my broke friends coexist
They love to mix 'em, we know what it is

[Chorus: Roisee]
Not done fighting (No way), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feeling (No way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten, but I can't give up
I'm still fighting (No way), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feeling (No way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten (No way), but I can't give up

[Verse 2: Roisee]
I can't find it in myself to just walk away
I can't find it in myself to lose everything
Feel everyone's against me, don't want me to be great
Things might look bad, not afraid to look death in the face
I'm good now (Now, now, no way), who's really bad?
I choose me now (Now, now), what's wrong with that?
Wish you could see me (No way)
Now, now, mmm, who had my back, baby?
Ain't belong, no love lost, good always will win

[Chorus: Roisee]
Not done fighting (Fighting, no way), I don't feel I've lost (Feel I've lost)
Am I dreamin'? (Dreaming) Is there more like us? (More like us)
Got me feeling (Feeling, no way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten (Beaten), but I can't give up (Can't give up)
I'm still fighting (No way), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feeling (No way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten (No way), but I can't give up

[Outro: Roisee]
Can't give up
Can't give, can't give up
Can't give up
Can't give, can't give up
Can't give up
Can't give, can't give up
Can't give up

Ye raaten ye mausam nadi

Ka kinaara ye chanchal hawa

Ye raaten ye mausam nadi

Ka kinaara ye chanchal hawa

Kaha do dilon ne ki mil kar

Kabhi na honge kabhi ham juda

Ye raaten ye mausam nadi ka

Kinaara ye chanchal hawa


Ye kya baat hai aaj

Ki chaandani mein

Ye kya baat hai aaj ki

Chaandani mein

Ke ham kho gaye

Pyaar ki raagini mein


Ye baahon mein baahen

Ye bahaki nigaahen

Lo aane laga zindagi ka maza

Ye raaten ye mausam nadi

Ka kinaara ye chanchal hawa


Sitaaron ki mahafil

Ne kar ke ishaara

Sitaaron ki mahafil

Ne kar ke ishaara

Kaha ab to saara

Jahaan hai tumhaara

Muhabbat javaan ho

Khula aasamaan ho

Kare koi dil aarazu aur ky

Ye raaten ye mausam nadi

Ka kinaara ye chanchal hawa


Kasam hai tumhe tum

Agar mujhase ruthe

Kasam hai tumhe tum

Agar mujhase ruthe

Rahe saans jab tak

Ye bandhan na toote

Tumhen dil diya hai

Ye vaada kiya hai sanam main

Tumhaari rahungi sada

Ye raaten ye mausam nadi ka

Kinaara ye chanchal hawa


Kaha do dilon ne ki mil kar

Kabhi ham nahonge juda

Ye raaten ye mausam nadi

Ka kinaara ye chanchal hawa

Re Fakira Maan Ja
Aaja Tujhko Pukaare
Teri Parchhaiyan

Re Kabira Maan Ja

Kaisa Tu Hai Nirmohi
Kaisa Harjaiyan

Tooti Charpai Wohi
Thandi Purvai Rasta Dekhe
Dudhon Ki Malai Wohi
Mitti Ki Surahi Rasta Dekhe

Kaisi Teri Khudgarzi
Lab Namak Rame Na Misri
Kaisi Teri Khudgarzi
Tujhe Preet Puraani Bisri

Mast Maula Mast Kalander
Tu Hawa Ka Ek Bawandar
Bujh Ke Yoon Andar Hi Andar
Kyun Reh Gaya

`[Intro]
Only you know me
The way you know me
Only you forgive me
When I'm sorry

[Verse 1]
Need you when I'm broken
When I'm fixed
Need you when I'm well
And when I'm sick
Friends that I rely on
Don't come through
They run like the river
But not you

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't see when I'm falling
Losing myself
But then I hear you calling

[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run

[Verse 2]
Whispers in the background
Behind closed doors
I got myself in a mess and without you, I'm in more
Oh, I'm a little drunk now
That's why I went to war
Oh yeah, you are my sober
When I'm on the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't see when I'm falling
Losing myself
But then I hear you calling

[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run

[Post-Chorus]
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are

[Bridge]
Need you when I'm hot and when I'm cold
Need you when I'm young
When I'm old
You won't be far

[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run

[Post-Chorus]
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are

[Outro]
(Need you when I'm, need you when I'm
Need you when I'm, need you when I'm)
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
There you are`,

`[Verse 1]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 2]
Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 3]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on`

,`[Verse 1]
Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right

[Pre-Chorus]
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

[Chorus]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again

[Verse 2]
Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Death can make you hard, hard, hard
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

[Chorus]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high

[Bridge]
When the moon is lookin' down
Shinin' light upon your ground
I'm flyin' up to let you see
That the shadow cast is me

[Chorus]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high`,

`[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Both]
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Both]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Both]
Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Both]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see, for you to see`,

`[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)
Uh

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Chorus: Charlie Puth, Wiz Khalifa]
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (You know where we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (Let me tell you)
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth, Wiz Khalifa]
Oh, oh
Ooh (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feelin' strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond'll never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth, Wiz Khalifa]
Oh (Uh), oh (Yeah-yeah; Yeah)
Ooh (Yo, yo, uh)
When I see you again (See you again, yeah, yeah)
Oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah, yeah; oh-oh)
Ooh (Uh-huh, yup)
When I see you again`,

`[Verse 1]
I just think about you
Got me wonderin' why
We never tried again
I can't live without you
I'm startin' to find this is a fight
I can never win

[Chorus]
I can't get you off my mind
You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind
Standing while we're wasting time

[Verse 2]
So go on without me
Into your life
Right out of mine again
It feels like a bad dream
I'm startin' to find this is a fight
I can never win

[Chorus]
I can't get you off my mind
You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind
Standing while we're wasting time
Wait, let me love
I get myself all tangled up
Wait, I need us
I get myself all tangled up

[Bridge]
On and on it goes
Now that I'm alone
Let me run
On and on it goes
Now that I'm alone
Let me run

[Chorus]
I can't get you off my mind
You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind
Standing while we're wasting time
Tell me why we're wasting time
Wait, let me love
I get myself all tangled up
Wait, I need us
(I need us)
I get myself all tangled up
(Get myself all tangled up)
Wait, let me love
(Can't get you off my mind)
I get myself all tangled up
(Get myself all tangled up)
Wait, I need us
(I need us)
I get myself all tangled up`,

Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
At night the city grows
Look at the horizon glow

[Verse 2]
Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Drinking in the lights
Following the neon signs
Waiting for a word (Word)
Looking at the milky skyline (Skyline)
The city is my church (The city is my church)
It wraps me in its blinding twilight (Twilight)

`[Verse 1: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

[Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

[Verse 2: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go

We've passed the end, so we chase forever
