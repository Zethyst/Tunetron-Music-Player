Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Needless to say, I keep in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (Wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (Wreck)
Needless to say, I'm keeping in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Every time I'm leavin' on ya (Ooh)
You don't make it easy, no (No, no)
Wish I could be there for ya (Ooh)
Give me a reason to, oh (Oh)
Every time I'm walkin' out (Oh)
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around (Oh, oh)
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down (No)
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (Now)
I know you're scared of the unknown (Known)
You don't wanna be alone (Alone)
I know I always come and go (And go)
But it's out of my control

[Chorus: Post Malone]
And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower (Yeah)`,

`You, you would always see the signs
The echoes in my head they rhyme
I feel we never went at all
Tomorrow is another day
I don't know when I'll feel anymore
Feeling all these things before
And all that I would do
You, you would always see the signs
The echoes in my head they rhyme
I felt they never went home at all
Tomorrow is another day that we need
I don't know where I'll be searching for these things I've seen
And I'm a feelin' all these things before I go through
All that I would do I do for you, no
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
'Round about a quarter past
We rustle up all inside
Of everyone and everything
That didn't owe us too well
And in our hearts
The matter is they know the reason too well
I heard the rain, when will it come?
When we (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
And I'd better get in control of this heavy vehicle
Or else I'll go and then I'll go and explode
To the place that I adore
Seen places on the shore
Where've you've been and where no sun is a sin
Been packin' all night long to get ready for some fun
And you go and you go evermore
I hate feeling in control
I want someone else's role
But I'm here and I'll do anythin'
Together this is a heart attack
I'm gonna get off in a sec
But for now I'm havin' way too much fun
To the place that I adore
Seen places on the shore
Where did you go and where did you go everyone?
Been packin' all night long to get ready for some fun
And you go and you go evermore
I hate feeling in control
I want someone else's role
But I'm here and I'll do anythin'`,

`[Intro]
Only you know me
The way you know me
Only you forgive me
When I'm sorry

[Verse 1]
Need you when I'm broken
When I'm fixed
Need you when I'm well
And when I'm sick
Friends that I rely on
Don't come through
They run like the river
But not you

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't see when I'm falling
Losing myself
But then I hear you calling

[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run

[Verse 2]
Whispers in the background
Behind closed doors
I got myself in a mess and without you, I'm in more
Oh, I'm a little drunk now
That's why I went to war
Oh yeah, you are my sober
When I'm on the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't see when I'm falling
Losing myself
But then I hear you calling

[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run

[Post-Chorus]
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are

[Bridge]
Need you when I'm hot and when I'm cold
Need you when I'm young
When I'm old
You won't be far

[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run

[Post-Chorus]
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are

[Outro]
(Need you when I'm, need you when I'm
Need you when I'm, need you when I'm)
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
There you are`,

`[Verse 1]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 2]
Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 3]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on`

,`[Verse 1]
Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right

[Pre-Chorus]
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

[Chorus]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again

[Verse 2]
Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Death can make you hard, hard, hard
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

[Chorus]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high

[Bridge]
When the moon is lookin' down
Shinin' light upon your ground
I'm flyin' up to let you see
That the shadow cast is me

[Chorus]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high`,

`[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Both]
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Both]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Both]
Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Both]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Both]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see, for you to see`,

`[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)
Uh

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Chorus: Charlie Puth, Wiz Khalifa]
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (You know where we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (Let me tell you)
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth, Wiz Khalifa]
Oh, oh
Ooh (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feelin' strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond'll never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth, Wiz Khalifa]
Oh (Uh), oh (Yeah-yeah; Yeah)
Ooh (Yo, yo, uh)
When I see you again (See you again, yeah, yeah)
Oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah, yeah; oh-oh)
Ooh (Uh-huh, yup)
When I see you again`,

`[Verse 1]
I just think about you
Got me wonderin' why
We never tried again
I can't live without you
I'm startin' to find this is a fight
I can never win

[Chorus]
I can't get you off my mind
You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind
Standing while we're wasting time

[Verse 2]
So go on without me
Into your life
Right out of mine again
It feels like a bad dream
I'm startin' to find this is a fight
I can never win

[Chorus]
I can't get you off my mind
You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind
Standing while we're wasting time
Wait, let me love
I get myself all tangled up
Wait, I need us
I get myself all tangled up

[Bridge]
On and on it goes
Now that I'm alone
Let me run
On and on it goes
Now that I'm alone
Let me run

[Chorus]
I can't get you off my mind
You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind
Standing while we're wasting time
Tell me why we're wasting time
Wait, let me love
I get myself all tangled up
Wait, I need us
(I need us)
I get myself all tangled up
(Get myself all tangled up)
Wait, let me love
(Can't get you off my mind)
I get myself all tangled up
(Get myself all tangled up)
Wait, I need us
(I need us)
I get myself all tangled up`,

[Verse 1]
Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
At night the city grows
Look at the horizon glow

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Drinking in the lights
Following the neon signs
Waiting for a word (Word)
Looking at the milky skyline (Skyline)
The city is my church (The city is my church)
It wraps me in its blinding twilight (Twilight)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car (Waiting in the car)
Waiting for the ride in the dark (Ride in the dark)
Waiting in the car (Car)
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car (Waiting in the car)
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car (Waiting in the car)
Waiting for the ride in the dark

`[Verse 1: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

[Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

[Drop: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

[Verse 2: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

[Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

[Drop: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know`]
