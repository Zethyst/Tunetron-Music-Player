var arr=[`[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
This morning I woke up in a fortress of distortion
I'm at war with my emotions, I'm at war with they enforcement
Tryna fight for what's right and got sidetracked
Where your mind at? Never mind that
Can we think in a blink, you swimmin', you sinkin'
You win, you leavin' a head where I've loaded my weapon
I stay with my brethren, I pray for protection
My prey in my sight so I'm doing what's right and not askin' no questions
I wanna be home free, where's one that was lonely?
But I'm ready and waitin'
For my day of salvation, and I'm patient

[Chorus: Richie Kohan]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm coming home now
I'm coming home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Right where I belong now
Right where I belong

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
They're looking for saviors, I'm looking for safety
They never gon' break me, take me
Down on my knees, believe I'm never gon' beg or plead
Yeah, I never say never, but I guarantee
Gather my strength, goin' hard in the paint
Paint you a picture, it's put on display
I'm gonna get, they don't give then I take
Can't take me down now
My feet on the ground now
Fight 'til I'm down now
Say it out loud now
Say it out loud, are you ready for war?

[Chorus: Richie Kohan]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm coming home now
I'm coming home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Right where I belong now
Right where I belong

[Outro: Richie Kohan]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Roisee & Young Thug]
Not done fighting, I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feeling like it's all too much
I feel beaten, but I can't give up
I'm still fighting (Metro), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feelin' like it's all too much
I feel beaten, but I can't give up

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh (No way), wakin' up, feelin' like the thankful one
Count up my 1s, lacin' up my favorite ones
One of a kind, one of one, the only one
Got one shot and one chance to take it once (No way)
Kiss my mama on the forehead, 'fore I get the code red
'Cause I was born, bred to go in, toast read
And swing by 410, beef patty, cornbread
In the concrete jungle, where my home is (No way)
All get focused, all range of toast is
For nickname, Mr. King-of-do-the-mostest
I was livin' down bad in my folks' crib
Now I'm laughin' to the bank and the joke is (No way)
Did more things than folks did or folks get
We've been gettin' this fly since some poor kids
My rich friends and my broke friends coexist
They love to mix 'em, we know what it is

[Chorus: Roisee]
Not done fighting (No way), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feeling (No way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten, but I can't give up
I'm still fighting (No way), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feeling (No way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten (No way), but I can't give up

[Verse 2: Roisee]
I can't find it in myself to just walk away
I can't find it in myself to lose everything
Feel everyone's against me, don't want me to be great
Things might look bad, not afraid to look death in the face
I'm good now (Now, now, no way), who's really bad?
I choose me now (Now, now), what's wrong with that?
Wish you could see me (No way)
Now, now, mmm, who had my back, baby?
Ain't belong, no love lost, good always will win

[Chorus: Roisee]
Not done fighting (Fighting, no way), I don't feel I've lost (Feel I've lost)
Am I dreamin'? (Dreaming) Is there more like us? (More like us)
Got me feeling (Feeling, no way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten (Beaten), but I can't give up (Can't give up)
I'm still fighting (No way), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feeling (No way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten (No way), but I can't give up

[Outro: Roisee]
Can't give up
Can't give, can't give up
Can't give up
Can't give, can't give up
Can't give up
Can't give, can't give up
Can't give up

`[Verse 1]
What time you coming out?
We started losing light
I'll never make it right
If you don't want me 'round
I'm so excited for the night
All we need's my bike and your enormous house
You said someday we might
When I'm closer to your height
'Til then, we'll knock around and see
If you're all I need

[Chorus]
Don't you see me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And on this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And maybe you, change your mind
I think I'm falling, I think I'm falling

[Verse 2]
I'm caught on your coat again
You said, "Oh no, it's fine"
I read between the lines and touched your leg again (Again)
I'll take it one day at a time
Soon you will be mine, oh
But I want you now (I want you now)
When the smoke is in your eyes
You look so alive
Do you fancy sitting down with me? (Maybe)
'Cause you're all I need

[Bridge]
According to your heart
My place is not deliberate
Feeling of your arms
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your neck

[Chorus]
Don't you see me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me? I
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And on this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And maybe you change your mind`,

그대를 바라볼 때면
모든 게 멈추죠
언제부턴지 나도 모르게였죠
어느 날 꿈처럼 그대 다가와
내 맘을 흔들죠
운명이란 걸 나는 느꼈죠
I love you, 듣고 있나요?
Only you, 눈을 감아봐요
바람에 흩날려 온 그대 사랑
Whenever, wherever you are
Whenever, wherever you are
Oh, love, love, love
어쩌다 내가 널 사랑했을까?
밀어내려 해도
내 가슴이 널 알아봤을까?
I love you, 듣고 있나요?
Only you, 눈을 감아봐요
모든 게 변해도 변하지 않아
넌 나의, 난 너의 사랑
그대 조금 돌아온대도
다시 나를 스쳐 지나더라도
괜찮아요, 그댈 위해 내가 여기 있을게
I love you, 잊지 말아요
Only you, 내 눈물의 고백
바람에 흩날려 온 그대 사랑
Whenever, wherever you are
Whenever, wherever you are

`[Verse 1]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 2]
Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 3]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on`

Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see

Through the secrets that I have seen

It's raining, on a Sunday night
The room is cold but I'm sitting, on the ground
And there is no sound, on a Sunday night
A sob, a sigh under the, city lights
I'm going crazy, on a Sunday night
Shadows are laughing at me an-other time

I won't just let it drag me down
Even if you don't help me out
I tried my best to, do without
All the things we've talked about

I won't just let it drag me down
Even if you don't help me out
I tried my best to, do without

The Sun is fading, on a Sunday night
The sound of the sirens clouding, every thought
And there is your song, on a Sunday night
The one you used to sing when, we were alright

I won't just let it drag me down
Even if you don't help me out
I tried my best to, do without
All the things we've talked about

Got me wonderin' why

You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind

Down the streets right through the city

We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cookin' like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eyes closed, yeah
Perfectin' my passion, thanks for askin'
Couldn't slow down, so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!

Ridin' with the plug, so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' offset
I look better on your girl than her outfit (Uh)

Stuck to the plan, always said that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from

Sharing my bread, yeah
Sharing my bread
Sharing my head
(I'm breaking down)
Sharing my heart
Sharing my, suddenly I'm
(Breaking down)
Sharing, I'm done
Sharing my life`,


`[Verse: Kavinsky & Sébastien Tellier]
I'm giving you a night call to tell you how I feel
(We'll go all, all, all night long)
I want to drive you through the night, down the hills
(We'll go all, all, all night long)
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear
(We'll go all, all, all night long)
I'm gonna show you where it's dark, but have no fear
(We'll go all, all, all night long)

[Chorus: Lovefoxxx]
There's something inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you, boy
But you're still the same
There's something inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you, boy
But you're still the same

`I'm hurt
And how could it be it was her?
My heart on a platter, she served
Ripped it out, is she Lecter?
Oh my God
Shit like this, I didn't deserve
Slipping on me, you got nerve
You told me the truth, still it burnt
Oh my God
How can you expect me to turn?
Turn a new leaf while I burned?
Oh my God, ooh
To tell you the truth, I was hurt
And you just stood there while I burned
Oh my God, ooh
Oh my God, ooh
Oh my God, ooh
Outta my way while I skrrt
The wind just might blow up your skirt
Oh my

So long, goodbye
Girl, I'm over your lies
Catch me fly up the skies
Up away
'Way, 'way, 'way
'Way
'Way
'Way
'Way
So long, goodbye
Girl, I'm over your lies
Catch me fly up the skies
Up away
So long, goodbye
Girl, I'm over your lies
Catch me fly up the skies
Up away

Tu murh ke na jaa veen hon sajna
Main teriyaan rawaan takdi phiraan
Main raj ke tenu hon taklaan
Tu murh ke na jaa veen hon sajna
Sajna tu na ja sajna
Tenu aj taklaan
Tere vich meri jaan
Tu na jaa

Sajna tu na ja sajna
Tenu aj taklaan
Tere vich meri jaan
Tu na jaa
Sajna tu jaa`
