Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Needless to say, I keep in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (Wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (Wreck)
Needless to say, I'm keeping in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Every time I'm leavin' on ya (Ooh)
You don't make it easy, no (No, no)
Wish I could be there for ya (Ooh)
Give me a reason to, oh (Oh)
Every time I'm walkin' out (Oh)
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around (Oh, oh)
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down (No)
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (Now)
I know you're scared of the unknown (Known)
You don't wanna be alone (Alone)
I know I always come and go (And go)
But it's out of my control

[Chorus: Post Malone]
And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower (Yeah)`,

[Chorus: Roisee & Young Thug]
Not done fighting, I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feeling like it's all too much
I feel beaten, but I can't give up
I'm still fighting (Metro), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feelin' like it's all too much
I feel beaten, but I can't give up

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh (No way), wakin' up, feelin' like the thankful one
Count up my 1s, lacin' up my favorite ones
One of a kind, one of one, the only one
Got one shot and one chance to take it once (No way)
Kiss my mama on the forehead, 'fore I get the code red
'Cause I was born, bred to go in, toast read
And swing by 410, beef patty, cornbread
In the concrete jungle, where my home is (No way)
All get focused, all range of toast is
For nickname, Mr. King-of-do-the-mostest
I was livin' down bad in my folks' crib
Now I'm laughin' to the bank and the joke is (No way)
Did more things than folks did or folks get
We've been gettin' this fly since some poor kids
My rich friends and my broke friends coexist
They love to mix 'em, we know what it is

[Chorus: Roisee]
Not done fighting (No way), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feeling (No way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten, but I can't give up
I'm still fighting (No way), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feeling (No way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten (No way), but I can't give up

[Verse 2: Roisee]
I can't find it in myself to just walk away
I can't find it in myself to lose everything
Feel everyone's against me, don't want me to be great
Things might look bad, not afraid to look death in the face
I'm good now (Now, now, no way), who's really bad?
I choose me now (Now, now), what's wrong with that?
Wish you could see me (No way)
Now, now, mmm, who had my back, baby?
Ain't belong, no love lost, good always will win

[Chorus: Roisee]
Not done fighting (Fighting, no way), I don't feel I've lost (Feel I've lost)
Am I dreamin'? (Dreaming) Is there more like us? (More like us)
Got me feeling (Feeling, no way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten (Beaten), but I can't give up (Can't give up)
I'm still fighting (No way), I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'? Is there more like us?
Got me feeling (No way), like it's all too much
I feel beaten (No way), but I can't give up

[Outro: Roisee]
Can't give up
Can't give, can't give up
Can't give up
Can't give, can't give up
Can't give up
Can't give, can't give up
Can't give up

`[Verse 1]
What time you coming out?
We started losing light
I'll never make it right
If you don't want me 'round
I'm so excited for the night
All we need's my bike and your enormous house
You said someday we might
When I'm closer to your height
'Til then, we'll knock around and see
If you're all I need

[Chorus]
Don't you see me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And on this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And maybe you, change your mind
I think I'm falling, I think I'm falling

[Verse 2]
I'm caught on your coat again
You said, "Oh no, it's fine"
I read between the lines and touched your leg again (Again)
I'll take it one day at a time
Soon you will be mine, oh
But I want you now (I want you now)
When the smoke is in your eyes
You look so alive
Do you fancy sitting down with me? (Maybe)
'Cause you're all I need

[Bridge]
According to your heart
My place is not deliberate
Feeling of your arms
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your neck

[Chorus]
Don't you see me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me? I
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And on this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And maybe you change your mind`,

그대를 바라볼 때면
모든 게 멈추죠
언제부턴지 나도 모르게였죠
어느 날 꿈처럼 그대 다가와
내 맘을 흔들죠
운명이란 걸 나는 느꼈죠
I love you, 듣고 있나요?
Only you, 눈을 감아봐요
바람에 흩날려 온 그대 사랑
Whenever, wherever you are
Whenever, wherever you are
Oh, love, love, love
어쩌다 내가 널 사랑했을까?
밀어내려 해도
내 가슴이 널 알아봤을까?
I love you, 듣고 있나요?
Only you, 눈을 감아봐요
모든 게 변해도 변하지 않아
넌 나의, 난 너의 사랑
그대 조금 돌아온대도
다시 나를 스쳐 지나더라도
괜찮아요, 그댈 위해 내가 여기 있을게
I love you, 잊지 말아요
Only you, 내 눈물의 고백
바람에 흩날려 온 그대 사랑
Whenever, wherever you are
Whenever, wherever you are

`[Verse 1]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 2]
Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 3]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on`

`[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Both]
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Both]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

Hardly anything there for you to see

It's raining, on a Sunday night
The room is cold but I'm sitting, on the ground
And there is no sound, on a Sunday night
A sob, a sigh under the, city lights
I'm going crazy, on a Sunday night
Shadows are laughing at me an-other time

[Chorus]
I won't just let it drag me down
Even if you don't help me out
I tried my best to, do without
All the things we've talked about

I won't just let it drag me down
Even if you don't help me out
I tried my best to, do without
All the things we've talked about

[Verse 2]
The Sun is fading, on a Sunday night
The sound of the sirens clouding, every thought
And there is your song, on a Sunday night
The one you used to sing when, we were alright

[Chorus]
I won't just let it drag me down
Even if you don't help me out
I tried my best to, do without
All the things we've talked about

I won't just let it drag me down
Even if you don't help me out
I tried my best to, do without
All the things we've talked about

I won't just let it drag me down
Even if you don't help me out
I tried my best to, do without
All the things we've talked about

`[Verse 1]
I just think about you
Got me wonderin' why
We never tried again
I can't live without you
I'm startin' to find this is a fight
I can never win

I can't get you off my mind
You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind
Standing while we're wasting time

[Verse 2]
So go on without me
Into your life
Right out of mine again
It feels like a bad dream
I'm startin' to find this is a fight
I can never win

[Chorus]
I can't get you off my mind
You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind
Standing while we're wasting time
Wait, let me love
I get myself all tangled up
Wait, I need us
I get myself all tangled up

[Bridge]
On and on it goes
Now that I'm alone
Let me run
On and on it goes
Now that I'm alone
Let me run

[Chorus]
I can't get you off my mind
You do this to me every night
I can't get you off my mind
Standing while we're wasting time
Tell me why we're wasting time
Wait, let me love
I get myself all tangled up
Wait, I need us

Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"

Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms

And when brotherhood come first, then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth, Wiz Khalifa]
Oh (Uh), oh (Yeah-yeah; Yeah)
Ooh (Yo, yo, uh)
When I see you again (See you again, yeah, yeah)
Oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah, yeah; oh-oh)
Ooh (Uh-huh, yup)
When I see you again`,


`[Verse 1]
And I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense, then you'll lose your mind
And I'll use you as a focal point
So I don't lose sight of what I want
And I've moved further than I thought I could
But I missed you more than I thought I would
And I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense, then you'll lose your mind

[Chorus]
Oh, and I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me
And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me

[Verse 2]
And I'll use you as a makeshift gauge
Of how much to give and how much to take
Oh I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense, then you'll lose your mind

[Chorus]
Oh, and I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me
And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me
And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me
And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me`,

`[Intro]
Only you know me
The way you know me
Only you forgive me
When I'm sorry

[Verse 1]
Need you when I'm broken
When I'm fixed
Need you when I'm well
And when I'm sick
Friends that I rely on
Don't come through
They run like the river
But not you

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't see when I'm falling
Losing myself
But then I hear you calling

[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run

[Verse 2]
Whispers in the background
Behind closed doors
I got myself in a mess and without you, I'm in more
Oh, I'm a little drunk now
That's why I went to war
Oh yeah, you are my sober
When I'm on the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't see when I'm falling
Losing myself
But then I hear you calling

[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run

[Post-Chorus]
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are

[Bridge]
Need you when I'm hot and when I'm cold
Need you when I'm young
When I'm old
You won't be far

[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run

[Post-Chorus]
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are

[Outro]
(Need you when I'm, need you when I'm
Need you when I'm, need you when I'm)
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
There you are`,

`[Verse 1]
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathin' in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

[Verse 2]
Let me be your 'leccy meter
An' I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater
That you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (Wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner (Wanna be yours)
Breathin' in your dust (Wanna be yours)
I wanna be your Ford Cortina (Wanna be yours)
I will never rust (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)`,

`[Verse 1]
You've been my muse for a long time
You get me through every dark night
I'm always gone, out on the go
I'm on the run and you're home alone
I'm too consumed with my own life

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move

[Chorus]
Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

[Verse 2]
I've been confused as of late (Yeah)
Watching my youth slip away (Yeah)
You're like the sun, you wake me up
But you drain me out if I get too much
I might need room or I'll break

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move

[Chorus]
Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

[Bridge]
Breaking down, breaking down, breaking down
Breaking down, breaking down, breaking down
I don't want to play this part
But I do, all for you
I don't want to make this hard
But I will 'cause I'm still

[Chorus]
Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now (I know I would)
Doing what I can, tryna be a man (Be your man)
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

[Outro]
Sharing my bed, uh
Sharing my bread, yeah
Sharing my bread
Sharing my head
(I'm breaking down)
Sharing my heart
Sharing my, suddenly I'm
(Breaking down)
Sharing, I'm done
Sharing my life`,

`[Verse 1]
I see you, you see me
How pleasant, this feeling
The moment you hold me
I missed you, I'm sorry
I've given what I have
I showed you I'm growing
The ashes fall slowly
As your voice consoles me

[Chorus]
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

[Verse 2]
We're swaying to drum beats
In motion, I'm feeling
My patience controlling
The question, I won't speak
We're telling the stories
Our laughter, he knows me
We're leaving, we're talking
You're closer, it's calming

[Chorus]
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

[Bridge]
The night will hold us close and the stars will guide us home
I've been waiting for this moment, we're finally alone
I turn to ask the question, so anxious, my thoughts
Your lips were soft like winter, in your passion, I was lost

[Chorus]
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know`,

I'm giving you a night call to tell you how I feel

I want to drive you through the night, down the hills

I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear

I'm gonna show you where it's dark, but have no fear

`[Verse 1]
Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right

Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again

[Verse 2]
Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Death can make you hard, hard, hard
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions

So fly high, so fly high

When the moon is lookin' down
Shinin' light upon your ground
I'm flyin' up to let you see
That the shadow cast is me

Birds fly in different directions

`I'm hurt
And how could it be it was her?
My heart on a platter, she served
Ripped it out, is she Lecter?
Oh my God
Shit like this, I didn't deserve
Slipping on me, you got nerve
You told me the truth, still it burnt
Oh my God
How can you expect me to turn?
Turn a new leaf while I burned?
Oh my God, ooh
To tell you the truth, I was hurt
And you just stood there while I burned
Oh my God, ooh
Oh my God, ooh
Oh my God, ooh
Outta my way while I skrrt
The wind just might blow up your skirt
Oh my

So long, goodbye
Girl, I'm over your lies
Catch me fly up the skies
Up away
'Way, 'way, 'way
'Way

Catch me fly up the skies
Up away
So long, goodbye

Sagar mein dikhte taaron
Jaise hum bhi mil jaayenge

Kathputli ke dhaage
Hum ko duur kahin le jaayenge
Sagar mein dikhte taaron
Jaise hum bhi mil jaayenge

Mai kyun, khoya khoya sa?
Ud raha hu par, yeh dil kyun doob raha?
Mai kyun, khoya khoya sa?
Ud raha hu par, yeh dil kyun doob raha?

Mai kyun, khoya khoya sa?
Ud raha hu par, yeh dil kyun doob raha?
Mai kyun, khoya khoya sa?
Ud raha hu par, yeh dil kyun doob raha?

Sunne, keh raha naseeb jo mujhi se

Chale, phir bhi teri dhun pe mann khudi se

Hum ko duur kahin le jaayenge
Sagar mein dikhte taaron
Jaise hum bhi mil jaayenge

Kathputli ke dhaage
Hum ko duur kahin le jaayenge
Sagar mein dikhte taaron
Jaise hum bhi mil jaayenge`
